# 4-print_alphabt.c

# Desctiption

### Alphabet printer Excluding (e and q)
This C program prints all the lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to 'z' on the console, excluding the letters 'e' and 'q'. It uses a for loop to iterate through each character and the putchar() function from the stdio.h library to display each character.

# 5-print_numbers.c

## Description

### Number Printer
This C program prints the numbers from 0 to 9 on the console. It uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers and the printf() function from the stdio.h library to display each number.

# 6-print_numberz.c

## Description

### Number Printer Using Putchar

# 7-print_tebahpla.c

## Description

### Reversed Lowercase Alphabet
This C program prints all the lowercase English alphabets in reverse order, from 'z' to 'a', on the console. It uses a while loop to iterate through the characters and the putchar() function from the stdio.h library to display each character.

# 8-print_base16.c

## Description

### Hexadecimal Number Printer
